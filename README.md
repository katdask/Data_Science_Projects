#### This repository contains material prepared for the semester class project of "Deep Learning" for the MSc in Data Science

### Deep Learning Semester Project Titled: "Facial Expressions & Facial Attributes Recognition with CNNs Using Tensoflow/Keras"

### Classification Tasks using Facial Expressions Dataset:
#### 1. Multiclass Classification of facial expressions, testing different models & parameters
#### Included in Notebook "Facial Expressions Classification"

### Classification Tasks using Facial Attributes Recognition Dataset:
#### 2. Binary Classification of facial attributes for 4 selected attributes 
#### 3. Transfer Learning from model developed on one attribute to predict another
#### 4. Multi-task Model to predict 3 attributes (multi-output)
#### Included in Notebook "Facial Attributes Classification"
